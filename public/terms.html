        Welcome to CryptoLoop. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to the following general terms and conditions. 
        These terms are intentionally lengthy, small, and difficult to read to illustrate typical boilerplate agreements. 
        Please consult with an advisor if you require clearer explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Eligibility: Users must be of legal age in their jurisdiction. Accessing the service indicates compliance with all 
        applicable regulations, including financial, tax, and digital asset laws. Users acknowledge sole responsibility for 
        understanding such regulations and CryptoLoop shall not be liable for any misuse or misunderstanding thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Account: Users agree to provide accurate and current information. CryptoLoop reserves the right to suspend or terminate 
        accounts at its discretion, including for suspected fraudulent activities, violation of policies, or security risks. 
        Passwords and authentication credentials must be maintained securely; loss of such credentials may result in permanent 
        loss of access to assets or services.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Services: CryptoLoop provides simulated trading, AI-based analysis, and educational dashboards. None of the features 
        constitute financial advice. Users acknowledge that all profits, returns, or simulations are illustrative only. CryptoLoop 
        makes no warranty of accuracy, timeliness, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, CryptoLoop shall not be liable for any indirect, 
        incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the platform, including but not limited to data loss, 
        opportunity loss, or system downtime. Users assume all risks associated with cryptocurrency markets and simulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Termination: CryptoLoop may modify, suspend, or discontinue services at any time without prior notice. Users may 
        terminate accounts voluntarily, but provisions related to intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations shall 
        survive such termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Governing Law: These terms are governed by the applicable laws of Malaysia and international agreements where relevant. 
        Any disputes arising shall be resolved exclusively within the competent courts of jurisdiction as determined by CryptoLoop.
      </p>
      <p>
        By continuing, you agree that you have read and understood these provisions, regardless of difficulty in readability, 
        and acknowledge acceptance of all stipulations herein.
