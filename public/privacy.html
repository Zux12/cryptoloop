        At CryptoLoop, your privacy is of the utmost importance. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and 
        protect your information. The following provisions are extensive, presented in small text, and somewhat difficult to 
        read, as is common in general privacy documents. Please review carefully to understand how your data may be processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Data Collection: We collect information you provide during registration such as name, email, and selected agent code. 
        Additionally, system-generated logs including IP addresses, device information, and browser metadata may be collected 
        automatically to improve security, troubleshoot errors, and optimize service performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Data Usage: Collected data may be used for account management, service improvement, security monitoring, marketing, 
        communication, and compliance with applicable laws. CryptoLoop does not sell personal information to third parties; 
        however, certain data may be shared with trusted partners who enable platform functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Data Retention: User data is retained for as long as the account remains active or as required to fulfill legal, 
        tax, audit, or compliance obligations. Upon termination, certain information may persist in backups or archival 
        systems for disaster recovery or regulatory purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Cookies and Tracking: CryptoLoop uses cookies, tokens, and related tracking technologies to facilitate login sessions, 
        enhance security, and analyze platform usage. Users may disable cookies in their browser, but doing so may limit 
        functionality or accessibility of services.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Security Measures: We implement technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards to protect data against 
        unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Nevertheless, no electronic transmission or storage 
        system can be guaranteed completely secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Third-Party Links: The platform may contain references or links to external websites or services. CryptoLoop is not 
        responsible for the privacy practices or content of such external parties. Users are encouraged to review external 
        privacy policies before engaging with those services.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Changes to Policy: CryptoLoop reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be posted 
        with revised dates, and continued use of the platform shall constitute acceptance of the updated provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By continuing to use CryptoLoop, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, regardless of 
        difficulty in readability, and consent to the processing of your personal information as outlined herein.
